## Phase 1: Pre-requisites

### Obtain License Key and Installation Materials

Contact your Spacelift sales representative to receive:

- **License token** - Required environment variable (`LICENSE_TOKEN`) for Spacelift to start
- **Installation archive** (e.g., `self-hosted-v3.0.0.tar.gz`) - Contains:
  - `spacelift-backend` container image
  - `spacelift-launcher` container image
  - `spacelift-launcher` binary (for non-Kubernetes workers)

---

### Choose Hostnames

[Environment Requirements: Choose Your Hostnames](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/environment-requirements#choose-your-hostnames) 🚀

Spacelift requires two hostnames to operate:

| Hostname | Example | Purpose | Who Needs Access |
|----------|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Server hostname** | `spacelift.example.com` | Spacelift web UI, GraphQL API, REST API, VCS webhooks | Users (browsers), VCS systems (GitHub/GitLab), workers |
| **MQTT broker hostname** | `mqtt.spacelift.example.com` | Worker-to-server communication for job scheduling | Workers only |

**MQTT hostname notes:**

- Only required if running workers **outside** the Spacelift cluster
- If workers run in the same Kubernetes cluster, you can use internal K8s DNS (e.g., `spacelift-mqtt.spacelift.svc.cluster.local`)
- The MQTT broker runs on a configurable port (default: `1984`)

---

### Prepare TLS Certificate

- [EKS: Server Certificate](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-eks#server-certificate) 🚀
- [ECS: Server Certificate](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-ecs#server-certificate) 🚀

The TLS certificate secures HTTPS access to the Spacelift server. It must be valid for your **server hostname** (e.g., `spacelift.example.com`).

**What the certificate protects:**

- User access to the Spacelift web UI
- GraphQL and REST API endpoints
- Inbound webhooks from VCS systems (e.g., GitHub push events)
- Worker HTTP requests to the server (e.g., state changes, log URL retrieval)

**Certificate requirements:**

- Must be valid for your server hostname
- Must be in *Issued* status before deployment (for ACM)
- Must be trusted by browsers and VCS systems

| Platform | Recommended Approach | Docs |
|----------|---------------------|------|
| AWS (EKS/ECS) | [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) 🔗 - provision before deployment, must be *Issued* | [EKS guide](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-eks#server-certificate) 🚀 |
| GKE | [Let's Encrypt via cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/) 🔗 - auto-provisioned during deployment | [GKE cert-manager setup](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-gke#cert-manager) 🚀 |
| AKS | [Let's Encrypt via cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/) 🔗 - auto-provisioned during deployment | [AKS cert-manager setup](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-aks#cert-manager) 🚀 |
| On-prem | Bring your own certificate or use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) 🔗 | [On-prem guide](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-onprem) 🚀 |

---

## Phase 2: External Dependencies

[External Dependencies Overview](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/external-dependencies) 🚀

### PostgreSQL Database (Required)

[Database Requirements](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/external-dependencies#database) 🚀

Spacelift stores all application data in PostgreSQL, including:

- Account and user information
- Stack, context, and policy configurations
- Run history and state
- Encrypted secrets and environment variables

**Requirements:**

- PostgreSQL version 14, 15, or 16 (v17+ not officially supported)
- Dedicated database with full administrative permissions
- Network accessible from Spacelift server, drain, and scheduler components
- Default port: `5432` (configurable)

**Supported versions:**

| Version | Status |
|---------|--------|
| PostgreSQL <= 13 | Not supported |
| PostgreSQL 14.x | Supported |
| PostgreSQL 15.x | Supported |
| PostgreSQL 16.x | Supported |
| PostgreSQL >= 17 | Not officially tested |

**Managed database options by platform:**

| Platform | Managed Service | Docs |
|----------|----------------|------|
| AWS | [Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) 🔗 | [RDS PostgreSQL docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html) 🔗 |
| AWS | [Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) 🔗 (Serverless v2 supported) | [Aurora PostgreSQL docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraPostgreSQL.html) 🔗 |
| GCP | [Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres) 🔗 | [Cloud SQL docs](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-instance) 🔗 |
| Azure | [Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql) 🔗 | [Azure PostgreSQL docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/overview) 🔗 |
| On-prem | Self-managed PostgreSQL | Not recommended to run in Kubernetes - use persistent volumes if you must |

**Terraform module behavior:**

- EKS/ECS modules create Aurora Serverless by default (`create_database = true`)
- GKE module creates Cloud SQL instance by default (`enable_database = true`)
- AKS module creates PostgreSQL Flexible Server by default
- Set to `false` to bring your own database

---

### Object Storage (Required)

[Object Storage Reference](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/object-storage) 🚀

Spacelift requires object storage to persist files including:

- **Run logs** - stdout/stderr from Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi, etc.
- **Terraform state files** - when using Spacelift as a state backend
- **Policy inputs** - cached inputs for policy evaluation
- **Workspace data** - uploaded workspaces for runs
- **Module artifacts** - for the private module registry
- **Webhook deliveries** - stored for debugging/replay

**Multiple buckets are created** - the Terraform modules handle this automatically.

**Supported providers:**

| Provider | Authentication | Docs |
|----------|---------------|------|
| Amazon S3 | IAM roles (EKS/ECS), access keys, instance profiles | [S3 Configuration](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/object-storage#amazon-s3) 🚀 |
| Google Cloud Storage | Workload Identity, service account keys, Application Default Credentials | [GCS Configuration](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/object-storage#google-cloud-storage) 🚀 |
| Azure Blob Storage | Workload Identity, managed identity, connection strings | [Azure Blob Configuration](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/object-storage#azure-blob-storage) 🚀 |
| MinIO | S3-compatible API with access keys | [MinIO Configuration](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/object-storage#minio) 🚀 |

**Buckets created by Terraform modules:**

- `deliveries` - webhook delivery storage
- `large-queue-messages` - oversized queue messages
- `metadata` - run metadata
- `modules` - private module registry
- `policy-inputs` - policy evaluation inputs
- `run-logs` - run output logs
- `states` - Terraform state files
- `uploads` - user uploads
- `user-uploaded-workspaces` - workspace uploads
- `workspace` - workspace data

---

### Encryption (Configurable)

[Encryption Reference](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/encryption) 🚀

Spacelift encrypts sensitive data stored in the database to prevent plaintext storage of secrets. Encryption is also used for signing JWT tokens for user sessions and API authentication.

**What gets encrypted:**

- Environment variables marked as secret
- Context values marked as secret
- Cloud integration credentials
- VCS integration tokens
- API keys

> **Critical decision - cannot be changed later:**
> Once you select an encryption method and deploy Spacelift, you **cannot migrate** to a different method. This would require re-encrypting all database entries, which is not supported.

| Option | Best For | How It Works | Docs |
|--------|----------|--------------|------|
| **AWS KMS** | AWS deployments (EKS/ECS) | Uses KMS keys for encryption and signing; keys never leave AWS | [KMS setup](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/encryption#kms) 🚀 |
| **RSA (built-in)** | GKE, AKS, on-prem | You generate an RSA private key and pass it via environment variable | [RSA key generation](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/encryption#rsa) 🚀 |

**KMS (AWS) details:**

- Two KMS keys are created: one for encryption, one for signing
- Terraform modules create these automatically
- Keys are referenced by ARN in configuration
- Spacelift components need `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:Sign`, `kms:Verify` permissions

**RSA (built-in) details:**

- You generate a 4096-bit RSA private key
- Key is base64-encoded and passed as `ENCRYPTION_RSA_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable
- Key must be kept secure - if compromised, all secrets are exposed
- Generate with: `openssl genrsa -out spacelift.key 4096 && base64 -w0 spacelift.key`

---

### Message Queue (Configurable)

[Message Queues Reference](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/message-queues) 🚀

Spacelift uses message queues for asynchronous job processing:

- Processing inbound VCS webhooks (e.g., GitHub push events)
- Scheduling runs
- Triggering policy evaluations
- Background cleanup tasks

| Option | Best For | How It Works | Docs |
|--------|----------|--------------|------|
| **Built-in (PostgreSQL-based)** | **Recommended for all new installations** | Uses PostgreSQL tables as a queue; no additional infrastructure | [Built-in setup](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/message-queues#built-in) 🚀 |
| **AWS SQS** | Existing installations, or if you prefer managed queues | Creates SQS queues for each message type | [SQS setup](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/message-queues#sqs) 🚀 |

**Built-in queue details:**

- Default for new installations
- No additional AWS/GCP/Azure resources needed
- Uses PostgreSQL for durability
- Configuration: `MESSAGE_QUEUE_TYPE=builtin` (or omit - it's the default)

**SQS queue details:**

- Multiple queues are created automatically by Terraform modules
- Required if using AWS IoT Core for MQTT
- Configuration: `MESSAGE_QUEUE_TYPE=sqs` plus queue URL environment variables
- IAM permissions needed: `sqs:SendMessage`, `sqs:ReceiveMessage`, `sqs:DeleteMessage`

---

### MQTT Broker (Configurable)

[MQTT Broker Reference](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/mqtt-broker) 🚀

The MQTT broker enables server-to-worker communication. It's used for:

- Broadcasting job scheduling messages to workers
- Notifying workers of run cancellations
- Worker heartbeat monitoring

Workers connect to the MQTT broker to receive real-time messages from the server. This is why MQTT uses a "push" model rather than polling.

| Option | Best For | How It Works | Docs |
|--------|----------|--------------|------|
| **Built-in** | **Recommended for most deployments** | MQTT broker runs embedded in the Spacelift server process | [Built-in MQTT setup](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/mqtt-broker#built-in) 🚀 |
| **AWS IoT Core** | Large-scale AWS deployments needing managed MQTT | Uses AWS IoT Core as external broker | [IoT Core setup](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/mqtt-broker#iot-core) 🚀 |

**Built-in broker details:**

- Runs on port `1984` by default (configurable)
- Exposed via Network Load Balancer (for external workers) or ClusterIP Service (for in-cluster workers)
- No TLS required for in-cluster communication; TLS recommended for external workers
- Configuration: `MQTT_BROKER_TYPE=builtin` (or omit - it's the default)

**IoT Core details:**

- **Requires AWS SQS** - cannot use built-in message queue with IoT Core
- Terraform modules create IoT Core resources automatically
- Workers authenticate using IoT credentials
- Configuration: `MQTT_BROKER_TYPE=iot-core` plus IoT endpoint configuration

---

## Phase 3: Infrastructure Deployment

[Environment Requirements](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/environment-requirements) 🚀

### Configure Networking

[Networking Reference](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/networking) 🚀

Spacelift consists of three main backend services plus workers. Each has specific networking requirements.

---

### Setup Container Registry and Push Images

[Container Registries](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/networking#container-registries) 🚀

Spacelift requires two container images from the installation archive:

| Image | Purpose | Required By |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `spacelift-backend` | Runs server, drain, and scheduler services | Kubernetes/ECS cluster |
| `spacelift-launcher` | Worker container for Kubernetes workers | Kubernetes worker nodes |

**Steps:**

1. Extract the installation archive: `tar -xzf self-hosted-v3.0.0.tar.gz`
2. Load images into Docker: `docker image load --input=container-images/spacelift-backend.tar`
3. Tag with your registry URL: `docker tag spacelift-backend:v3.0.0 your-registry/spacelift-backend:v3.0.0`
4. Push to registry: `docker push your-registry/spacelift-backend:v3.0.0`
5. Repeat for `spacelift-launcher`

**Platform-specific registry setup:**

| Platform | Registry | Login Command | Push Docs |
|----------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| AWS | Amazon ECR | `aws ecr get-login-password --region $REGION \| docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $ECR_URL` | [EKS: Push Images](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-eks#push-images-to-elastic-container-registry) 🚀 |
| GCP | Artifact Registry | `gcloud auth configure-docker $REGION-docker.pkg.dev` | [GKE: Push Images](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-gke#push-images-to-artifact-registry) 🚀 |

```bash
tofu output -raw kubernetes_secrets | kubectl apply -f -
```

This creates secrets containing:

- Database connection strings
- License token
- Encryption keys (RSA private key or KMS ARNs)
- Admin credentials
- Object storage configuration

### ECS Deployment

[Deploying to ECS](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-ecs) 🚀

For ECS, the services are deployed via the Terraform module rather than Helm:

1. Deploy infrastructure module first (`terraform-aws-spacelift-selfhosted`)
2. Push container images to ECR
3. Deploy services module (`terraform-aws-ecs-spacelift-selfhosted`)

```bash
# After deploying infra and pushing images, enable services
export TF_VAR_deploy_services=true
tofu apply
```

## Phase 5: DNS Configuration

- [EKS DNS](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-eks#configure-your-dns-zone) 🚀
- [GKE DNS](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-gke#configure-your-dns-zone) 🚀
- [AKS DNS](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/deploying-to-aks#configure-your-dns-zone) 🚀

After deployment, create DNS records pointing to your load balancers.

**Get load balancer addresses:**

```bash
# Server (HTTP) - Kubernetes
kubectl get ingress -n spacelift

# MQTT broker - Kubernetes (if using external workers)
kubectl get service spacelift-mqtt -n spacelift
```

**Create DNS records:**

| Record | Type | Value | Purpose |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| `spacelift.example.com` | CNAME | `k8s-spacelif-serverv4-xxx.region.elb.amazonaws.com` | Server (UI/API) |
| `mqtt.spacelift.example.com` | CNAME | `k8s-spacelif-mqtt-xxx.elb.region.amazonaws.com` | MQTT broker (external workers only) |

**GKE note:** GKE may require both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records:

```
spacelift.example.com    A     ${PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS}
spacelift.example.com    AAAA  ${PUBLIC_IPV6_ADDRESS}
```

## Phase 6: First Setup

[First Setup Guide](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/first-setup) 🚀

### Login with admin credentials

[Admin Login](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/first-setup#logging-in-using-admin-credentials) 🚀

Navigate to `https://your-server-hostname` (e.g., `https://spacelift.example.com`).

You'll be redirected to the admin login screen. Use the credentials configured during deployment:

- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - from Terraform variables
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - from Terraform variables

**Direct admin login URL:** `https://your-server-hostname/admin-login`

[Admin login configuration](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/general-configuration#admin-login) 🚀

---

### Create account

[Creating an Account](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/guides/first-setup#creating-an-account) 🚀

After logging in, choose an account name. This is used for:

- Display in the Spacelift UI
- AWS external ID and session names (cloud integration)
- Private registry URLs (modules/providers)

**Requirements:**

- 2-38 characters
- Must start with letter or number
- Only letters, numbers, `-`, and `_`

> **Choose carefully** - changing account names after deployment can break integrations (AWS trust policies, webhooks, etc.)

---

### Configure SSO/IdP (optional)

[Login Policy](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/concepts/policy/login-policy) 🚀

Spacelift supports SSO via:

- SAML 2.0
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- GitHub OAuth
- GitLab OAuth

Configure in **Settings > Single Sign-On** after initial setup.

---

### Setup VCS integration

[Source Control Integrations](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/integrations/source-control) 🚀

Connect Spacelift to your source control system to:

- Create stacks from repositories
- Receive push webhooks to trigger runs
- Post PR comments with plan output
- Access source code during runs

| VCS Provider | Setup Guide |
|--------------|-------------|
| GitHub (Cloud or Enterprise) | [GitHub Integration](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/integrations/source-control/github) 🚀 |
| GitLab (Cloud or Self-Managed) | [GitLab Integration](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/integrations/source-control/gitlab) 🚀 |

---

### Create worker pool

[Worker Pools Overview](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/concepts/worker-pools) 🚀

Workers execute your infrastructure-as-code runs. You need at least one worker pool before creating stacks.

| Worker Type | Best For | Setup Guide |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Kubernetes Workers** | Kubernetes deployments (EKS/GKE/AKS) - workers run as pods | [Kubernetes Workers](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/concepts/worker-pools/kubernetes-workers) 🚀 |
| **Docker-based Workers** | EC2/VM deployments - workers run in Docker on instances | [Docker Workers](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/concepts/worker-pools/docker-based-workers) 🚀 |

**Kubernetes worker setup:**

1. Create a dedicated namespace: `kubectl create namespace spacelift-workers`
2. Create a WorkerPool in Spacelift UI
3. Create K8s secret with worker pool credentials
4. Deploy the WorkerPool CRD

> **Important:** Configure resource limits on WorkerPools to prevent unbounded resource requests. See [Run Pods configuration](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/concepts/worker-pools/kubernetes-workers#run-pods) 🚀.

---

### Disable admin login (optional)

[Admin Login Reference](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/installing-spacelift/reference-architecture/reference/general-configuration#admin-login) 🚀

After configuring SSO, you can disable admin login by removing the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables from your deployment.

---

## Phase 7: Validation

- [ ] **Verify Spacelift UI loads** at `https://your-server-hostname`
- [ ] **Verify workers connect** - Check worker pool in Spacelift UI shows workers as "idle"
- [ ] **Create test stack** - [Create a Stack](https://docs.spacelift.io/self-hosted/latest/getting-started/create-stack) 🚀
- [ ] **Trigger a run** - Verify run completes successfully
